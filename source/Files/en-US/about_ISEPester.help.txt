SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Module with ISE tools for Pester v5+

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Working with Pester is relatively easy in VS Code.
    The problem is - some people prefer to use PowerShell ISE and miss similar functionality there.

    This module makes it possible to introduce similar support.
    Initial version adds single command (Invoke-ISECurrentTest) that:
    - checks location of the cursor in the current file
    - tries to understand tests that need to run
    - runs only these tests using Detailed output

EXAMPLES
    PS C:\> Invoke-ISECurrentTest
    Runs test in the currently open test file, based on the location of the cursor.

NOTE:
    Thank you to all those who contributed to this module, by writing code, sharing opinions, and provided feedback.

TROUBLESHOOTING NOTE:
    Look out on the Github repository for issues and new releases.
